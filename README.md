# No-Code Overlays Website

This is the code for nodecodeoverlays.com, which currently shows a "Coming Soon" message. I wanted to purchase a domain name and get something online in preparation for this year's [Just F\*ing Ship It Challenge](https://womenmake.com/30-day-challenge-2020).

## Preview as of September 26th, 2020

![A white page with black text. At the top is the site title "No-Code Overlays". Below it, smaller body text reads, "Empowering anyone to create interactive streaming overlays without learning how to code." At the bottom is small text and a link that reads "Made by Ashlee M Boyer". In the middle is a yellow square that looks like a sticky note. It is turned at an angle. It has 4 lines of text with the most emphasis on the third line, a countdown. It reads, "Coming Soon! October 21st, 2020 5pm ET. 35d 3h 5m 40s. Check in periodically for details."](./public/preview.png)
